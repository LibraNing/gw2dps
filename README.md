Notes
=======

- Make sure GW2 keybinds aren't conflicting with the ones I hardcoded above.
- Before launching GW2DPS switch GW2 to "Windowed"/"Windowed Fullscreen" mode (Options->Graphics->Resolution). Once GW2ESP is running, feel free to switch back to Fullscreen. 
- Some reported SweetFX caususing compatiblity issues. If it's causing crashes, switch it off.
- If you have a 64 bit (x64) version of MS Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable installed, uninstall it. 
- If app is complaining about missing MSVCP120d.dll, install vsredist_x86.exe from the dist folder.
- If app is complaining about missing dx3dx9_43.dll, install dxwebsetup.exe from the dist folder.
